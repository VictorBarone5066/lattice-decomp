This is code from when I still thought that using the
Kabsch algorithm was a good idea for comparing two chemical
enviornments.  

The reasons that I switched is because:
(1) The Kabsch algorithm requires that vectors be 
correlated BEFORE the start of the algo - this basically
makes it useless for doing what I want.
(2) It is a bit slower than what I'm now considering doing:
100,000 comparisons takes about 5 seconds with 5 sweeps per
comparison and about 4.2 atoms per enviornment.  Adding a 
fix to (1) would surely add a good amount of time to this.
